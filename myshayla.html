                    <strong>Dear Ruan Chan</strong>
                    <p>I hope you are having a wonderful day. I'm writing this letter to express my feelings to you. I like you, suki desu, gusto tika. You mean more to me than just someone I enjoy spending time with. I just want to be honest with you and let you know my feelings.

                        I don’t want to put any pressure on you, and I’m not asking for anything in return. I just felt like you deserved to know how I feel because you’re important to me. Thank you for always being yourself, for making me smile, and for just being a part of my life. Whatever happens, I’m glad we’ve crossed paths. </p>
